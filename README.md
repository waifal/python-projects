## Programs

### Bagels

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess:

"Pico" when your guess has a correct digit in the *wrong* place, "Fermi" when your guess has a correct digit in the *correct* place, and "Bagels" if your guess has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.
